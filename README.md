# Overview



In this project, I am analyzing the marriages and divorces from 2015 - 2020. All of the data comes from 
New Zealand. I wanted to see how marriage and divorce has been affected throughout the years as well as 
the impact of COVID-19. 

I wrote this software to learn more about data analysis. I know I scraped just the surface of it and but had
a lot of fun with this project.
